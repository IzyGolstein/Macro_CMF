# Short resume
Hi! I'm 19 years old HSE student, my major is economics and I'm extremely intrested in data science and data analytics. Last year i spent studying Python and data-oriented libraries such as Pandas, sklearn, Numpy, xgboost, plotly, matpotlib, etc. I participated in two kaggle competitions: banking scoring and prediction of user churn. While studying at the CMF, i built a few functions, providing an opportunity to import macro data into python in the most convenient way and even make a gif with a distribution of choosen macro variable on the map. Now I'm CMF Graduate program student, Deep Learning School student and School of Analytics student. Below I'll I will describe the files with my projects:
